Writing this review after few days of use.', "Well the first impression about the back panel color is - it's blue rather than green! nevertheless it looks cool and feels premium. The glass finish is shiny, but I would recommend to use the rubber back cover that comes with the box. But you might have to invest to buy a transparent, bumper cover in the long run.", 'Display - It is awesome as I keep looking the phone just to admire the different wall papers and text settings, etc. Colors are deep and rich! Almost zero bloatware.', 'Battery - For a mild to medium user like me(about 3 Hrs of active usage), the battery has lasted for more than 24 Hrs. Also the fast charger works as expected. Full charge in less than an hour.', 'Audio - Yes, I do miss the 3.5MM Jack especially as my old phone had that feature. However, the call quality through the device and through the BT earphones are ultra clear. No default music player app provided as in Samsung devices, but  YT music/Spotify can fulfill your music needs. Hearing songs through built in speakers was good', 'It comes with other bells and whistles like - favorite contacts widget, customizable always-on-display and in-display fingerprint sensor , battery saving mode, etc. I particularly like the fingerprint animation settings.', 'Performance - well for my moderate usage I have not faced any problems so far. Stutter free scrolling, and apps are getting loaded in a jiffy and all the apps work smoothly; notifications work very well. Videos played well. Actually, nothing to complain here in these few days of usage.', 'Camera - Honestly not able to test it in different conditions, but both day and night photos seem to come out well. Video calls quality is also great.', 'Also, the phone does not feel heavy to hold. Even people with small hands should not have a problem in holding and operating the phone.', 'I hope I can write a detailed review after few weeks of thorough usage. Thanks!', 'Read more']
