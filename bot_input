['My initial impressions of this phone are:', '1. Design and feel is great.', '2. Display is beautiful and smooth.', '3. Main camera is below average for the price it is being offered but on the other hand front camera is good. (To get better pictures from the main camera just turn off the AI processing and you are good to go)', '4. Impressed with the super fast charging but it is draining quickly if compared to other 5000mah phones.', '5. Battery standby is really good.', "6. This phone was bought for normal use and not for gaming so I haven't checked it's gaming performance.", '7. Social media apps like Instagram, fb, WhatsApp are working smooth.', '8. OIS is a joke when it comes to video recording, worst stability I have seen in this price segment but OIS works fine while capturing photos. I hope Realme release some updates regarding this issue.', "Overall, this phone is for someone who is looking for a decent camera and fast charging with great design. Battery standby is beneficial for working professionals but can't recommend this device for travelers unless they have fast charging power banks with them. I'm yet to check the camera quality with gcam, I'll edit my review then.", 'Read more']
